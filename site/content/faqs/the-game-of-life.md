      If you are using an iOS device, please try tapping the Restore Purchases
      button on the Settings screen. Make sure you’re logged in to the same
      Apple account that was used for the original purchase.


      If you are using an Android device, you should be able to restore your
      purchases by tapping the Buy button again from the in-game shop. Don’t
      w#orry, you won’t be charged twice, as long as you are using the same
      Google Play account that was used for the original purchase. Please make
      sure to tap the exact same thing as you did when you bought the original
      in-app purchase. 


      In both cases, you may need to kill the app and restart for this to take
      effect.


      If this still doesn’t work, please email us screenshots of the following:


      * Your purchase order receipt(s). For Android, we need to see the GPA
      number.

      * The in-game Settings screen.


      We can then use this information to resolve the problem.
    question: 'I bought an in-app purchase (IAP), but my content is still locked'

      Our refund policy is that on Google Play we will consider a refund if the
      request is made within 48 hours of the initial purchase. Please email us
      with the reason for the refund request, and proof of purchase (including
      the GPA number).


      For Apple, Steam or Nintendo Switch purchases, we cannot process refunds.
      Please contact the relevant platform holder.

      We appreciate that some players do not like the concept of further
      purchases in a premium game. However, the majority of our players
      appreciate the opportunity to enhance their experience with different
      aesthetics. Each theme is created by a team of talented artists who
      delight in dreaming up beautiful new worlds for our players.
    question: I don’t like that there is IAP in a premium app
  - answer: >-
      We understand concerns about the privacy notifications we introduced to be
      compliant with new European GDPR laws. Rest assured that we only request
      access for benign reasons. The third party multiplayer services we use
      will only work if we request access, and the only data we track is for
      analytics that help us understand how our players are using the game, so
      that we can make improvements to their experience. We do not allow third
      parties to access your data. You can opt out of everything by refusing
      consent.
    question: Why do you ask for access to my data on first installing the app?
  - answer: >-
      When we update our apps, sometimes we need every user to upgrade (so that
      all multiplayer uses are on compatible versions). If no update is
      appearing on the app store, first ensure that you have set your apps to
      update automatically. If this is already the case, try manually refreshing
      the app store for updates. If this still doesn’t work, please try again
      later - sometimes it can take up to 24 hours for updates to propagate to
      all app stores around the world.
    question: >-
      The game tells me to update, but no update is there when I go to the app
      store
  - answer: >-
      Yes, you can share the core app via Family Sharing/Family Library, but any
      in-app purchases cannot be shared. This is due to restrictions imposed by
      Apple and Google.
    question: Can I share the game via Family Sharing/Family Library?
  - answer: >-
      No. If you have purchased the app on one platform, you must purchase it
      again if you want to play it on the other platform.
    question: 'Can I transfer the app from iOS to Android, or vice versa?'
  - answer: >-
      We are sorry to hear that you are having issues installing our game.


      Error 505 is a kind of permission error that is not caused by our app but
      from the Google Play store.


      There are several reasons why it could occur but most of the times its
      fixed by clearing the data and cache of the Google Play app and Google
      Play Services framework:


      Go to Settings > Apps. Scroll down and select "Google Play Store". Select
      Storage > "Clear Cache" and "Clear Data"


      Go to Settings > Apps. Scroll down and select "Google Play Services".
      Select Storage > "Clear Cache" and "Clear Data"


      Restart your phone, download the game again and try to install the game.


      If this still doesn’t work, there are some further troubleshooting tips
      below, but bear in mind that this is an error from the Google Play Store,
      not a Marmalade specific error, so if the problem persists then please
      contact Google Play directly.




      1) Check whether Download Manager is Enabled.


      * Go to Settings

      * Press Apps

      * Select All

      * Scroll down until you find Download Manager

      * Check it is enabled




      2) Check if there are any updates to the Operating System of your Android
      device.


      * Go to Settings 

      * Press About

      * Check if there are any updates




      3) Reinstall Play Store updates by following these instructions:


      * Go to Settings

      * Press Apps

      * Press Google Play Store

      * Press Uninstall Updates

      * Open Google Play Store


      It will refresh the updates within 5 to 10 minutes (keep your internet
      connection on while Google Play Store is updating).


      Install the game
    question: I’m having problems installing the game from Google Play (Error 505)

      We are aware that some players are experiencing freezes, where the game
      becomes unresponsive, particularly in Online games. We apologise to all
      players who have encountered this issue. We have already released a number
      of updates, and we will continue to find and fix freeze bugs until the
      game is rock solid. Please bear with us while we track down these issues,
      and thank you in advance for your patience.
    question: The game keeps freezing
  - answer: >-
      We are aware that some players are experiencing an issue where Online
      games skip the lobby stage and go straight into the game, but there are no
      players and the game never starts. We apologise to all players who have
      encountered this issue. Rest assured that we are trying our hardest to
      track down the cause of this issue and fix it.
    question: Online games do not begin properly
  - answer: >-
      We are aware that currently Online games are not very tolerant of poor
      connection issues or briefly leaving the app. We are working on enabling
      players to reconnect to Online games after a brief period of connection
      loss or app suspension. This will be rolled out in an update soon, along
      with many other cool new features.
    question: I get disconnected from Online games very easily
  - answer: >-
      We can assure you that the game's chance mechanics (dice rolls, cards,
      etc) are completely random and luck-based. Rigged games are unfair and no
      fun, and our goal as game developers is always to deliver the best gaming
      experience possible. We know that sometimes it can feel like the AI get
      all the breaks, but this really is pure chance - we’d have nothing to gain
      by making the AI cheat!


      Regarding difficulty - we are aware that some players are finding even
      Easy AI too hard, and we are continuing to tweak its behaviour (in terms
      of strategy and trading behaviour) to make it easier.
    question: The game is too hard - is it rigged?
  - answer: >-
      Yes, we are currently investigating adding statistics to the game as part
      of a future update, along with many other exciting features and
      improvements.
    question: Will you add statistics to the game?
  - answer: >-
      We are aware that some players are experiencing frustration with the speed
      of the game in Single Player mode. We have already updated the game to
      allow players to dismiss UI elements (e.g. Chance cards) by tapping, and
      to speed up token movement, and we will continue to speed up the game
      wherever we can.
    question: The game is too slow
  - answer: >-
      Please make sure that all players have updated to the latest version of
      the app. You can check the version number on the Settings screen. If
      players are on different versions, they will be unable to join a lobby
      together.
    question: >-
      Play With Friends says “Invalid Code” even though I entered the code
      correctly
  - answer: >-
      Unfortunately, it sounds like you own the old Monopoly app which was
      developed by a different studio that is no longer supporting it. We, at
      Marmalade Game Studio, only released our version of the game in 2019.
      Regrettably, since our studio isn't affiliated with this other developer,
      there is nothing we can do.
    question: 'I bought an old version of this game, and now I have to pay for it again?'
