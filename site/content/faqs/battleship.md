      If you are using an iOS device, please try tapping the Restore Purchases
      button on the Settings screen. Make sure you’re logged in to the same
      Apple account that was used for the original purchase.


      If you are using an Android device, you should be able to restore your
      purchases by tapping the Buy button again from the in-game shop. Don’t
      w#orry, you won’t be charged twice, as long as you are using the same
      Google Play account that was used for the original purchase. Please make
      sure to tap the exact same thing as you did when you bought the original
      in-app purchase. 


      In both cases, you may need to kill the app and restart for this to take
      effect.


      If this still doesn’t work, please email us screenshots of the following:


      * Your purchase order receipt(s). For Android, we need to see the GPA
      number.

      * The in-game Settings screen.


      We can then use this information to resolve the problem.
    question: 'I bought an in-app purchase (IAP), but my content is still locked'

      Our refund policy is that on Google Play we will consider a refund if the
      request is made within 48 hours of the initial purchase. Please email us
      with the reason for the refund request, and proof of purchase (including
      the GPA number).


      For Apple, Steam or Nintendo Switch purchases, we cannot process refunds.
      Please contact the relevant platform holder.

      We appreciate that some players do not like the concept of further
      purchases in a premium game. However, the majority of our players
      appreciate the opportunity to enhance their experience with different
      aesthetics. Each theme is created by a team of talented artists who
      delight in dreaming up beautiful new worlds for our players.
    question: I don’t like that there is IAP in a premium app
  - answer: >-
      We understand concerns about the privacy notifications we introduced to be
      compliant with new European GDPR laws. Rest assured that we only request
      access for benign reasons. The third party multiplayer services we use
      will only work if we request access, and the only data we track is for
      analytics that help us understand how our players are using the game, so
      that we can make improvements to their experience. We do not allow third
      parties to access your data. You can opt out of everything by refusing
      consent.
    question: Why do you ask for access to my data on first installing the app?
  - answer: >-
      When we update our apps, sometimes we need every user to upgrade (so that
      all multiplayer uses are on compatible versions). If no update is
      appearing on the app store, first ensure that you have set your apps to
      update automatically. If this is already the case, try manually refreshing
      the app store for updates. If this still doesn’t work, please try again
      later - sometimes it can take up to 24 hours for updates to propagate to
      all app stores around the world.
    question: >-
      The game tells me to update, but no update is there when I go to the app
      store
  - answer: >-
      Yes, you can share the core app via Family Sharing/Family Library, but any
      in-app purchases cannot be shared. This is due to restrictions imposed by
      Apple and Google.
    question: Can I share the game via Family Sharing/Family Library?
  - answer: >-
      No. If you have purchased the app on one platform, you must purchase it
      again if you want to play it on the other platform.
    question: 'Can I transfer the app from iOS to Android, or vice versa?'
  - answer: >-
      We are sorry to hear that you are having issues installing our game.


      Error 505 is a kind of permission error that is not caused by our app but
      from the Google Play store.


      There are several reasons why it could occur but most of the times its
      fixed by clearing the data and cache of the Google Play app and Google
      Play Services framework:


      Go to Settings > Apps. Scroll down and select "Google Play Store". Select
      Storage > "Clear Cache" and "Clear Data"


      Go to Settings > Apps. Scroll down and select "Google Play Services".
      Select Storage > "Clear Cache" and "Clear Data"


      Restart your phone, download the game again and try to install the game.


      If this still doesn’t work, there are some further troubleshooting tips
      below, but bear in mind that this is an error from the Google Play Store,
      not a Marmalade specific error, so if the problem persists then please
      contact Google Play directly.


      1. Check whether Download Manager is Enabled.


      * Go to Settings

      * Press Apps

      * Select All

      * Scroll down until you find Download Manager

      * Check it is enabled


      2. Check if there are any updates to the Operating System of your Android
      device.


      * Go to Settings 

      * Press About

      * Check if there are any updates


      3. Reinstall Play Store updates by following these instructions:


      * Go to Settings

      * Press Apps

      * Press Google Play Store

      * Press Uninstall Updates

      * Open Google Play Store

      * It will refresh the updates within 5 to 10 minutes (keep your internet
      connection on while Google Play Store is updating).

      * Install the game
    question: I’m having problems installing the game from Google Play (Error 505)
  - answer: >-
      It sounds like the game files were corrupted during installation. Please
      follow the following steps to try and fix the issue:


      * Go to your application manager and select The Game of Life

      * Press Storage

      * Clear Data and Cache

      * Uninstall The Game of Life

      * Restart your phone

      * Install The Game of Life and try to open it again
    question: The game crashes on the Hasbro splash screen
  - answer: >-
      The Game of Life requests access to your storage in order to finish the
      download of the app, which would not be possible unless the installation
      files could be saved on your device. We don’t view, use or store your data
      anywhere.
    question: Why does the game need access to my photos?
  - answer: >-
      You may have selected a vehicle that is in a pack that you don’t own. This
      will be indicated by a green shopping cart button underneath it. Select a
      different vehicle (one that you own) and you should be able to start the
      game.
    question: 'I can access the game setup menus, but I can’t start the game'
  - answer: >-
      Unfortunately, as of right now, we have no plans to update the Steam
      version of The Game of Life with the extra content available in the mobile
      versions.
    question: Will the mobile DLC be made available on the Steam version?
  - answer: >-
      There might be an issue with the Facebook connection. Take the following
      steps to try and force the connection again:


      * Make sure both players have the Facebook app installed on your devices
      and are logged in

      * Also log in to Facebook on the web browser in your devices

      * While on Facebook, go to Settings > Apps, and clear The Game of Life
      from the list

      * Open The Game of Life again and a message should appear saying your
      Facebook connection has expired and asking you to login again


      After this, you should be able to invite the other player normally. Make
      sure that they have the game open and is either on the Main Menu or on the
      World Selection screen.
    question: I’m having problems creating a game with my Facebook friend
  - answer: >-
      Unfortunately, it sounds like you own the old Monopoly app which was
      developed by a different studio that is no longer supporting it. We, at
      Marmalade Game Studio, only released our version of the game in 2019.
      Regrettably, since our studio isn't affiliated with this other developer,
      there is nothing we can do.
    question: 'I bought an old version of this game, and now I have to pay for it again?'
