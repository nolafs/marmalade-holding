      If you are using an iOS device, please try tapping the Restore Purchases
      button on the Settings screen. Make sure you’re logged in to the same
      Apple account that was used for the original purchase.


      If you are using an Android device, you should be able to restore your
      purchases by tapping the Buy button again from the in-game shop. Don’t
      w#orry, you won’t be charged twice, as long as you are using the same
      Google Play account that was used for the original purchase. Please make
      sure to tap the exact same thing as you did when you bought the original
      in-app purchase. 


      In both cases, you may need to kill the app and restart for this to take
      effect.


      If this still doesn’t work, please email us screenshots of the following:


      * Your purchase order receipt(s). For Android, we need to see the GPA
      number.

      * The in-game Settings screen.


      We can then use this information to resolve the problem.
    question: 'I bought an in-app purchase (IAP), but my content is still locked'

      Our refund policy is that on Google Play we will consider a refund if the
      request is made within 48 hours of the initial purchase. Please email us
      with the reason for the refund request, and proof of purchase (including
      the GPA number).


      For Apple, Steam or Nintendo Switch purchases, we cannot process refunds.
      Please contact the relevant platform holder.

      We’re very sorry that you are experiencing problems with our game. Please
      try fully powering off your device, and restarting, to see if this

      issue persists, please email us with details of your issue. Thank you in
      advance for your patience and understanding.

      We’re very sorry that you are experiencing problems with our game. Please

      * Your platform (e.g. iOS, Android, PC, Nintendo Switch)

      * Your device model and OS version

      We appreciate that some players do not like the concept of further
      purchases in a premium game. However, the majority of our players
      appreciate the opportunity to enhance their experience with different
      aesthetics. Each theme is created by a team of talented artists who
      delight in dreaming up beautiful new worlds for our players.
    question: I don’t like that there is IAP in a premium app

      We understand concerns about the privacy notifications we introduced to be
      compliant with new European GDPR laws. Rest assured that we only request
      access for benign reasons. The third party multiplayer services we use
      will only work if we request access, and the only data we track is for
      analytics that help us understand how our players are using the game, so
      that we can make improvements to their experience. We do not allow third
      parties to access your data. You can opt out of everything by refusing
      consent.
    question: Why do you ask for access to my data on first installing the app?
  - answer: >-
      When we update our apps, sometimes we need every user to upgrade (so that
      all multiplayer uses are on compatible versions). If no update is
      appearing on the app store, first ensure that you have set your apps to
      update automatically. If this is already the case, try manually refreshing
      the app store for updates. If this still doesn’t work, please try again
      later - sometimes it can take up to 24 hours for updates to propagate to
      all app stores around the world.
    question: >-
      The game tells me to update, but no update is there when I go to the app
      store
  - answer: >-
      Yes, you can share the core app via Family Sharing/Family Library, but any
      in-app purchases cannot be shared. This is due to restrictions imposed by
      Apple and Google.
    question: Can I share the game via Family Sharing/Family Library?
  - answer: >-
      No. If you have purchased the app on one platform, you must purchase it
      again if you want to play it on the other platform.
    question: 'Can I transfer the app from iOS to Android, or vice versa?'
