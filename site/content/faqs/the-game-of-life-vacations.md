      If you are using an iOS device, please try tapping the Restore Purchases
      button on the Settings screen. Make sure you’re logged in to the same
      Apple account that was used for the original purchase.


      If you are using an Android device, you should be able to restore your
      purchases by tapping the Buy button again from the in-game shop. Don’t
      worry, you won’t be charged twice, as long as you are using the same
      Google Play account that was used for the original purchase. Please make
      sure to tap the exact same thing as you did when you bought the original
      in-app purchase. 


      In both cases, you may need to kill the app and restart for this to take
      effect.


      If this still doesn’t work, please email us screenshots of the following:


      * Your purchase order receipt(s). For Android, we need to see the GPA
      number.

      * The in-game Settings screen.


      We can then use this information to resolve the problem.
