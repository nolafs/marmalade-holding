      If you are using an iOS device, please try tapping the Restore Purchases
      button on the Settings screen. Make sure you’re logged in to the same
      Apple account that was used for the original purchase.


      If you are using an Android device, you should be able to restore your
      purchases by tapping the Buy button again from the in-game shop. Don’t
      w#orry, you won’t be charged twice, as long as you are using the same
      Google Play account that was used for the original purchase. Please make
      sure to tap the exact same thing as you did when you bought the original
      in-app purchase. 


      In both cases, you may need to kill the app and restart for this to take
      effect.


      If this still doesn’t work, please email us screenshots of the following:


      * Your purchase order receipt(s). For Android, we need to see the GPA
      number.

      * For Clue/Cluedo, please provide a screenshot of the second page of the
      Settings screen (swipe from the right).


      We can then use this information to resolve the problem.
    question: 'I bought an in-app purchase (IAP), but my content is still locked'

      Our refund policy is that on Google Play we will consider a refund if the
      request is made within 48 hours of the initial purchase. Please email us
      with the reason for the refund request, and proof of purchase (including
      the GPA number).


      For Apple, Steam or Nintendo Switch purchases, we cannot process refunds.
      Please contact the relevant platform holder.

      We appreciate that some players do not like the concept of further
      purchases in a premium game. However, the majority of our players
      appreciate the opportunity to enhance their experience with different
      aesthetics. Each theme is created by a team of talented artists who
      delight in dreaming up beautiful new worlds for our players.
    question: I don’t like that there is IAP in a premium app
  - answer: >-
      We understand concerns about the privacy notifications we introduced to be
      compliant with new European GDPR laws. Rest assured that we only request
      access for benign reasons. The third party multiplayer services we use
      will only work if we request access, and the only data we track is for
      analytics that help us understand how our players are using the game, so
      that we can make improvements to their experience. We do not allow third
      parties to access your data. You can opt out of everything by refusing
      consent.
    question: Why do you ask for access to my data on first installing the app?
  - answer: >-
      When we update our apps, sometimes we need every user to upgrade (so that
      all multiplayer uses are on compatible versions). If no update is
      appearing on the app store, first ensure that you have set your apps to
      update automatically. If this is already the case, try manually refreshing
      the app store for updates. If this still doesn’t work, please try again
      later - sometimes it can take up to 24 hours for updates to propagate to
      all app stores around the world.
    question: >-
      The game tells me to update, but no update is there when I go to the app
      store
  - answer: >-
      Yes, you can share the core app via Family Sharing/Family Library, but any
      in-app purchases cannot be shared. This is due to restrictions imposed by
      Apple and Google.
    question: Can I share the game via Family Sharing/Family Library?
  - answer: >-
      No. If you have purchased the app on one platform, you must purchase it
      again if you want to play it on the other platform.
    question: 'Can I transfer the app from iOS to Android, or vice versa?'
  - answer: >-
      We are sorry to hear that you are having issues installing our game.


      Error 505 is a kind of permission error that is not caused by our app but
      from the Google Play store.


      There are several reasons why it could occur but most of the times its
      fixed by clearing the data and cache of the Google Play app and Google
      Play Services framework:


      Go to Settings > Apps. Scroll down and select "Google Play Store". Select
      Storage > "Clear Cache" and "Clear Data"


      Go to Settings > Apps. Scroll down and select "Google Play Services".
      Select Storage > "Clear Cache" and "Clear Data"


      Restart your phone, download the game again and try to install the game.


      If this still doesn’t work, there are some further troubleshooting tips
      below, but bear in mind that this is an error from the Google Play Store,
      not a Marmalade specific error, so if the problem persists then please
      contact Google Play directly.


      1. Check whether Download Manager is Enabled.


      * Go to Settings

      * Press Apps

      * Select All

      * Scroll down until you find Download Manager

      * Check it is enabled


      2. Check if there are any updates to the Operating System of your Android
      device.


      * Go to Settings 

      * Press About

      * Check if there are any updates


      3. Reinstall Play Store updates by following these instructions:


      * Go to Settings

      * Press Apps

      * Press Google Play Store

      * Press Uninstall Updates

      * Open Google Play Store

      * It will refresh the updates within 5 to 10 minutes (keep your internet
      connection on while Google Play Store is updating).

      * Install the game
    question: I’m having problems installing the game from Google Play (Error 505)
  - answer: >-
      We are aware that some players are having problems with the local
      multiplayer feature, and we apologise to those who are affected. This is a
      particularly difficult issue for us to trace because it involves third
      party multiplayer matchmaking code, but rest assured that we are
      investigating the problem and hope to have a solution soon.


      In the meantime, some players have found that the problem can be
      temporarily worked around by deleting and reinstalling both the
      Switch/Steam game and the Cluesheet Companion on the mobile device. We
      apologise for the inconvenience.
    question: >-
      I can’t use the Cluesheet Companion app with my Nintendo Switch/Steam
      version of the game - it always says “Invalid Code”
  - answer: >-
      Please make sure that all players have updated to the latest version of
      the app. You can check the version number on the second page of the
      Settings screen. If players are on different versions, they will be unable
      to join a lobby together.
    question: >-
      Play With Friends says “Invalid Code” even though I entered the code
      correctly
  - answer: >-
      Please try reinstalling the game and clearing the game data from Settings
      > Apps > Clue/Cluedo > Storage > Clear Data
    question: I get a black screen when I try to load the game on my Android device
  - answer: >-
      Yes, if you log into Facebook on the device you purchased the IAP, you
      will then be able to install the app on a different device (even a
      different platform) and recover the IAP by logging into the same Facebook
      account on the second device.
    question: Can I share my in-app purchases (IAP) over several devices?
  - answer: >-
      You can change the difficulty of your game on the AI Select screen. Tap
      the character profiles of the AI you have added to the game - this cycles
      between Easy/Medium/Hard for that particular AI. For the hardest possible
      game, add 5 AI and set them all to Hard.
    question: How do you change difficulty?
  - answer: >-
      You will have to buy the core game again, but if you have bought the
      Season Pass or any IAP content on the mobile version, you can transfer it
      across to the Steam version. We will also transfer IAP content from Steam
      to mobile. Send us an email with proof of purchase and your in-game
      username, and we will process the transfer.
    question: >-
      I’ve already bought the game and theme content on mobile. Do I have to buy
      it again on Steam?
