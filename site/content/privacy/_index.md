use a website or online property, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if
they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that

also be subject to their own privacy policies.

choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide

may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video. The
information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing

activity on other websites.

remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other
organizations such as advertisers. Quite often advertising cookies will be linked to site
functionality provided by the other organization. In certain countries our websites may partner
with third party online advertising and analytics companies to tailor and deliver
advertisements, products, services, and promotions on our websites and other online
properties, as well as advertisements, products, services, and promotions on websites and
other online properties which we do not control. To help select the ads of greatest interest to
you, these companies may use cookies, Flash technology, and similar technologies to collect
and track non-personal information such as demographic information (e.g., gender,
occupation, etc.), aggregated information, search keywords, geo-location and online data (for
example, clickstream data such as browser type, language, IP address, time/date) to select
advertisements that are more relevant to your interests, to better personalize the experience
for you and tailor advertisements. In some instances, we may allow third party companies to
collect certain anonymous information when you visit our website. These companies may use
non-personally identifiable information during your visits to this and other websites in order to
provide third party advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to
