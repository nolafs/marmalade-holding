## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is set out by Marmalade Game Studio Ltd. (including its wholly owned
subsidiaries) (“Marmalade”) of 2 - 7 Clerkenwell Green, London, EC1R 0DE, UK as at 1 st November
2017 and as amended from time-to-time.

This Privacy Policy is applicable to mobile phone or tablet applications provided, sold or
distributed to you by Marmalade.

It is Marmalade’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while
operating our applications.

### App Users

Like most app operators, Marmalade collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
that operators of mobile apps typically collect.

Non-personally-identifying information collected includes but is not limited to the ID for advertisers
(iOS), Google Advertising ID (Google), Platform, Device, OS version, IP address, Install timestamp
and Boot-up timestamp and specific Application events.

Marmalade’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
how customers use our products.

By choosing to use Marmalade mobile or tablet applications you hereby consent to such activities.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Marmalade only collects personal information from you on a voluntary basis. The amount and
type of information that Marmalade gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.

For example, certain Marmalade mobile or tablet applications may offer customers to sign up for an
account by providing an email address.

Certain Marmalade mobile or tablet applications enable you to interact through or on third-party
social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter (or third-party social media plug-ins and
applications) (“Social Media”). When you engage with our content on or through Social Media, you
may allow us to have access to certain information from your

Social Media profile (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends,
people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the ‘likes’ you make) to deliver the content or
as part of the operation of the application. We may also obtain other information from your
interaction with our content (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information
about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on).


Social Media sites and applications will often allow you to control what data you share by changing
your privacy settings with that Social Media site or application. For more information about how
your Social Media sites and applications use and protect your personal information, please refer to
their privacy policies and terms of use. Marmalade mobile or tablet applications are intended for
general audiences and Marmalade does not knowingly collect any personal information from
children under 13.We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from
young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names,
addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when online. Children under the age of 17 and
over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review this Privacy Policy and to contact us if
they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns.

### Aggregated Statistics

We partner with certain mobile analytics, advertising, and technology partners. Such mobile
partners may use a tracking pixel, agent or any other visitor identification technology that
collects, uses, shares and stores data about end users and digital ad campaigns promoting our
mobile or tablet applications.

Marmalade may use and share non-personally identifiable (e.g., anonymized or aggregated)
information obtained from mobile or tablet applications with third parties such as service providers,
analytics or advertising partners. An example of the use of such information would be a comparison
between two anonymous groups of end users to compare the performance of different versions of
the mobile application.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Any information you choose to submit is collected and used by Marmalade Game Studio Ltd., 2 - 7
Clerkenwell Green, London, EC1R 0DE United Kingdom.

Marmalade may disclose personal information to vendors or employ vendors to collect personal
information on Marmalade's behalf. These vendors provide internal support to our websites and
other online properties by operating some of the services we provide.

If you are a customer from outside the U.S., the personal information you choose to provide may be
collected, processed and stored directly on servers in the United States or other countries where
Marmalade or our affiliates, subsidiaries, agents or vendors maintain facilities or business operations.

Marmalade does not share or sell your personal information with outside third parties for those
third parties to use for their own purposes without your agreement. Marmalade discloses personal
information only in accordance with this Privacy Policy with Vendors as set out above, and other
third parties as necessary to complete any transaction through our websites or other online
properties and/or provide Online Services you have requested.


If you do not agree to the collection, processing, storage and transfer of your information, please
do not provide your information when requested and stop using these features and services.

are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other
government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements,
or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability. We may review your personal
information in order to investigate allegations of cheating, hacking or any other breach or alleged

consultants and law enforcement or other government officials. In addition, in the event of a merger,
acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, Marmalade's customer information
including personal information may be transferred to our successor or other designated party.

### Privacy Policy Changes
